## **üöÄ Features**

1. **Introduction to Fluids**

   * Overview of what fluids are and how they differ from solids.
   * Real-world examples for better understanding.

2. **States of Matter Simulation**

   * Visual demo of **solid, liquid, and gas** particles.
   * Animations to show how molecules behave in different states.

3. **Viscosity & Flow Rate Control**

   * Interactive slider to control flow rate.
   * Helps visualize **viscosity changes** in real time.

4. **Real vs. Ideal Fluids**

   * Side-by-side simulation of object motion in **ideal** and **real** fluids.
   * Demonstrates drag and resistance clearly.

5. **Quiz & Practice Module**

   * Multiple-choice quiz with instant feedback.
   * Final score and explanations to support learning.
