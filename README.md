Physics Learning App
An interactive web application designed to help users visualize and understand fundamental concepts in fluid mechanics. This project features engaging simulations and a comprehensive quiz to reinforce key principles.

üöÄ Features
1. Introduction to Fluids: A concise overview of what fluids are, their characteristics, and the differences between liquids and gases.

2. States of Matter Simulation: A visual demonstration of particle behavior in solids, liquids, and gases, highlighting their molecular structure and movement.

3. Viscosity & Flow Rate: An interactive slider that lets users control the flow rate of a fluid, providing a hands-on understanding of viscosity and its effects.

4. Real vs. Ideal Fluids: A side-by-side comparison of how an object moves through an ideal fluid (no friction) versus a real fluid (with friction), demonstrating the concept of drag.

5. Quiz & Practice: A multiple-choice quiz that tests user knowledge on the topics covered, with instant feedback and a final score.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
1. React: The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.

2. React Three Fiber: A powerful renderer for creating 3D graphics and simulations within a React application.

3. Framer Motion: A production-ready animation library for adding smooth, fluid motion to UI elements.

4. Vite: A fast build tool for a streamlined development experience.
